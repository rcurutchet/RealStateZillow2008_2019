Analysis of Housing Market in Santa Clara County from 2008 to 2019

Introduction: Rent and/or mortgage take a significant percentage of our monthly income/budget. Given the impact of those numbers in our lives, we found interesting to analyze the trajectory of housing prices in the county many of us live in: Santa Clara. Given that, we compared data found for this county to data from other places inside and outside the country, so one can assess how valuable this market is. Our goal is to present the rise of housing prices throughout the last decade, highlighting the appreciation of Real Estate after the "Housing Bubble", which led the US - nearly a decade ago - to the biggest economical crisis since 1929.
